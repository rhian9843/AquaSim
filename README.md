# Fluid Hydrodynamics Simulation

This project demonstrates the simulation of fluid dynamics using Unity and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). It aims to create realistic fluid behaviors and interactions by implementing the principles of fluid dynamics.

## Features

- Realistic fluid movement and interaction using SPH
- Dynamic visualization of fluid dynamics
- Highly customizable parameters for simulation behavior

## Tech Stack

- **Unity**: Game engine used for development and visualization
- **C#**: Programming language used for scripting
- **Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)**: Method used for simulating fluid dynamics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2022.3 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rhian9843/fluid-simulation.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Unity:
    - Launch Unity Hub
    - Click on "Open"
    - Select the cloned project directory

### Usage

1. Open scene (2D): `Assets/Scenes/Test A (2D).unity`
2. Open scene (Improved 2D): `Assets/Scenes/Test B (2D).unity`
3. Open scene (3D): `Assets/Scenes/Test C (3D).unity`
4. Press the "Play" button in the Unity Editor to start the fluid simulation

### Customization

You can adjust various parameters in the simulation scripts to change the behavior and appearance of the fluid dynamics.

## How It Works

This project uses Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate the motion of fluid substances. SPH is a computational method for simulating fluid flows, where the fluid is represented by particles. The simulation is visualized using Unity's rendering engine, providing an interactive and dynamic representation of fluid dynamics.
